# Plan: Building a Conversational E-commerce Product Search Agent

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for developing, deploying, and maintaining a RAG-based agentic application for conversational product search.

## Phase 0: Foundation & Technology Stack Setup

**Objective:** Prepare the development environment and make key technology choices.

-   **Step 1: Project Initialization**
    -   [ ] Set up a Git repository for version control.
    -   [ ] Create a virtual environment (`venv` or `conda`).
    -   [ ] Define project structure (e.g., `/data`, `/src`, `/notebooks`, `/tests`).

-   **Step 2: Select Technology Stack**
    -   [ ] **Backend Framework:** FastAPI (recommended for performance and ease of use) or Flask.
    -   [ ] **Agent/LLM Framework:** LangChain or LlamaIndex (provides abstractions for agents, tools, and RAG pipelines).
    -   [ ] **LLM & Embedding Model:** Choose a provider (e.g., Google Gemini API, OpenAI API). You'll need access to both a powerful generative model and a text-embedding model.
    -   [ ] **Primary Database:** Identify your existing product database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB).
    -   [ ] **Vector Database:** Choose a vector store (e.g., Google Vertex AI Vector Search for a managed solution, or self-hosted options like ChromaDB, Weaviate, or Pinecone).
    -   [ ] **Frontend Framework:** React, Vue, or Angular for the chat interface.

## Phase 1: Data Preparation & Ingestion (The "Retrieval" Foundation)

**Objective:** Process and embed product data to make it searchable.

-   **Step 3: Define Data Schema for Search**
    -   [ ] Analyze your product data (`categories`, `description`, `usage`, `name`, `brand`).
    -   [ ] Define a unified text document format for each product that will be embedded. *Example: "Product: [Name]. Brand: [Brand]. Category: [Category]. Description: [Description]. Ideal for: [Usage]."*

-   **Step 4: Implement the ETL & Embedding Pipeline**
    -   [ ] Write a script (`ingest.py`) that:
        -   [ ] Connects to the primary product database.
        -   [ ] Extracts all product information.
        -   [ ] Transforms the data into the defined text document format (from Step 3).
        -   [ ] Initializes the chosen text-embedding model.
        -   [ ] Generates vector embeddings for each product document.
        -   [ ] Stores the embeddings along with product IDs and metadata in the chosen Vector Database.

-   **Step 5: Initial Data Ingestion**
    -   [ ] Run the ETL pipeline to populate the Vector Database with your entire product catalog.
    -   [ ] Set up a scheduler (e.g., cron job, Airflow DAG) to run this pipeline periodically to keep the search index synchronized with the main product database.

## Phase 2: Core Agent & Tool Development

**Objective:** Build the agent's brain and the tools it will use.

-   **Step 6: Develop the `SemanticSearchTool`**
    -   [ ] Create a function that takes a natural language query as input.
    -   [ ] The function should query the Vector Database to find the top-k most similar products.
    -   [ ] It should return a structured list of product IDs or product data.

-   **Step 7: Develop the `StructuredFilterTool`**
    -   [ ] Create a function that can parse structured requests (e.g., using function calling capabilities of the LLM).
    -   [ ] Input could be parameters like `brand`, `category`, `price_range`.
    -   [ ] The function should construct a query (e.g., SQL or NoSQL query) and execute it against the **primary product database**.
    -   [ ] It should return a list of matching products.

-   **Step 8: Build the Orchestrator Agent**
    -   [ ] Using your chosen framework (LangChain/LlamaIndex), initialize the LLM.
    -   [ ] Define the tools (`SemanticSearchTool`, `StructuredFilterTool`) and provide clear descriptions for each so the agent knows when to use them.
    -   [ ] Construct the agent's main prompt, instructing it to act as a helpful e-commerce assistant, use the provided tools to answer questions, and manage conversation history.
    -   [ ] Implement a mechanism to manage conversation history (e.g., `ConversationBufferMemory`).

## Phase 3: API & Backend Integration

**Objective:** Expose the agent's functionality through a web-friendly API.

-   **Step 9: Create a Backend API**
    -   [ ] Using FastAPI, create an API endpoint (e.g., `/chat`).
    -   [ ] This endpoint should accept a JSON payload containing the user's message and a conversation ID.
    -   [ ] It will pass the message to the Orchestrator Agent.
    -   [ ] It will receive the agent's response and send it back as a JSON object.
    -   [ ] Implement basic session management to handle conversation history per user.

## Phase 4: Frontend Development

**Objective:** Build the user-facing chat interface.

-   **Step 10: Build the Chat UI**
    -   [ ] Using a frontend framework (React, etc.), create a simple chat window.
    -   [ ] The UI should handle user input and display the conversation history.
    -   [ ] Implement API calls from the frontend to the `/chat` endpoint on the backend.
    -   [ ] Add features like typing indicators and rendering product cards (image, name, price) in the chat.

## Phase 5: Testing & Deployment

**Objective:** Ensure the application is robust and deploy it to a production environment.

-   **Step 11: Integration and End-to-End Testing**
    -   [ ] Connect the frontend application to the backend API.
    -   [ ] Conduct thorough testing with various queries:
        -   Simple semantic search ("a comfy chair").
        -   Structured search ("laptops from Apple").
        -   Mixed queries ("comfy chairs from IKEA under $200").
        -   Follow-up questions ("which of those are red?").
        -   Out-of-scope questions.

-   **Step 12: Deployment**
    -   [ ] Containerize the backend application (using Docker).
    -   [ ] Containerize the frontend application.
    -   [ ] Deploy the containers to a cloud provider (e.g., Google Cloud Run, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure App Service).
    -   [ ] Ensure your databases (Primary and Vector) are accessible from your deployed application.

## Phase 6: Monitoring & Iteration

**Objective:** Continuously improve the agent's performance based on real-world usage.

-   **Step 13: Set Up Logging & Monitoring**
    -   [ ] Log all conversations (anonymized if necessary) for analysis.
    -   [ ] Monitor API performance, latency, and error rates.
    -   [ ] Use a tool like LangSmith or a custom dashboard to trace agent decisions and tool usage.

-   **Step 14: Gather Feedback & Iterate**
    -   [ ] Analyze conversation logs to identify common failure points or queries the agent struggles with.
    -   [ ] Add a "thumbs up/down" feedback mechanism in the UI.
    -   [ ] Use the feedback to:
        -   Fine-tune the agent's main prompt.
        -   Improve the tool descriptions.
        -   Adjust the data format used for embeddings.
        -   Potentially fine-tune the LLM itself on a dataset of high-quality conversations (advanced).
